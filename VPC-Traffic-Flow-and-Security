## Project 2: VPC Traffic Flow and Security

**Goal:** Control traffic in your VPC by configuring a route table, a network ACL, and a security group.  
**Time Taken:** ~20 mins

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Create and Configure Route Table
- Go to **VPC Dashboard > Route Tables > Create route table**
- Name: `PublicRouteTable`
- Select your custom VPC
- Click **Create**
- Select the new route table > go to **Routes > Edit routes**
  - Add route:
    - Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
    - Target: your Internet Gateway (e.g., `igw-xxxxxx`)
  - Save
- Go to **Subnet associations > Edit subnet associations**
  - Select your public subnet
  - Save

#### 2. Create Network ACL (NACL)
- Go to **Network ACLs > Create Network ACL**
- Name: `my-acl-1`
- Select your custom VPC
- Click **Create**
- Select the NACL > go to **Inbound Rules > Edit inbound rules**
  - Rule #: 100  
  - Type: All traffic  
  - Protocol: All  
  - Port range: All  
  - Source: `0.0.0.0/0`  
  - Allow
- Go to **Outbound Rules > Edit outbound rules**
  - Same as above but with **Destination: 0.0.0.0/0**
- Go to **Subnet associations > Edit**
  - Associate it with your public subnet

#### 3. Configure Security Group
- Go to **EC2 Dashboard > Security Groups > Create Security Group**
- Name: `security-group-1`
- Select your custom VPC
- Inbound rules:
  - Type: **HTTP**
  - Protocol: TCP
  - Port: 80
  - Source: `0.0.0.0/0`
- Outbound rules: Keep default (all allowed)
- Attach this security group to any EC2 instance you launch in the public subnet

---

### Summary

This setup ensures that:
- The subnet routes internet traffic through the internet gateway
- The NACL allows all traffic in and out
- The security group allows public HTTP access (port 80)

My VPC is now ready to host web-accessible EC2 instances.
