## Project 6: VPC Peering

**Goal:** Connect two custom VPCs to allow private communication between their EC2 instances using a VPC Peering connection.  
**Time Taken:** ~1 hour

---

### What I Did

- Created two VPCs using the VPC Wizard:
  - VPC 1 with CIDR `12.1.0.0/16`
  - VPC 2 with CIDR `12.2.0.0/16`
- Launched one EC2 instance in each VPC (no key pair)
- Assigned an Elastic IP to the VPC 1 EC2 instance to connect via EC2 Instance Connect
- Created a VPC Peering connection between the two VPCs
- Updated route tables to allow traffic to pass between VPCs
- Allowed ICMP traffic in the VPC 2 security group to test connectivity with `ping`

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create VPC 1**
   - Go to VPC > Create VPC > “VPC and more”
   - Name: `NetWork-1`, CIDR: `12.1.0.0/16`
   - 1 public subnet, no private subnets, no NAT gateway, no VPC endpoint

2. **Create VPC 2**
   - Name: `NetWork-2`, CIDR: `10.2.0.0/16`
   - 1 public subnet, rest same as VPC 1

3. **Create Peering Connection**
   - Go to Peering Connections > Create
   - Requester: `NetWork-1`, Accepter: `NetWork-2`
   - Accept the request from the console

4. **Update Route Tables**
   - In `NextWork-1` route table:
     - Add: Destination `12.2.0.0/16`, Target: the peering connection
   - In `NextWork-2` route table:
     - Add: Destination `12.1.0.0/16`, Target: the peering connection

5. **Launch EC2 Instances**
   - Launch `Instance - NetWork VPC 1` in VPC 1
     - Use default security group, disable auto-assign public IP
   - Launch `Instance - NetWork VPC 2` in VPC 2
     - Same steps as above

6. **Allocate Elastic IP**
   - Go to Elastic IPs > Allocate > Associate with Instance VPC 1
   - Now connect to it using EC2 Instance Connect

7. **Fix SSH Connection**
   - Go to the instance’s security group
   - Add inbound rule:
     - Type: SSH, Source: Anywhere-IPv4 (`0.0.0.0/0`)

8. **Test Connectivity**
   - From EC2 in VPC 1, `ping [PRIVATE IP of VPC 2 instance]`
   - If it fails, fix the security group for VPC 2

9. **Fix VPC 2 Security Group**
   - Edit inbound rules:
     - Type: All ICMP - IPv4
     - Source: `12.1.0.0/16` (VPC 1 CIDR)

### Summary

In this project, I learned how to use the VPC Wizard to quickly create VPCs, set up a peering connection, and route traffic between them. I connected instances across VPCs using private IPs and verified with `ping`. I also learned how to troubleshoot SSH and ICMP access using Elastic IPs, security groups, and routing.
