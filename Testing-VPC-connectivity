## Project 5: Testing VPC Connectivity

**Goal:** Test connectivity between public and private EC2 instances and verify internet access from the public instance.  
**Time Taken:** ~30–45 minutes

---

### What I Did

- Connected to the public EC2 instance using EC2 Instance Connect
- Attempted to ping the private EC2 instance using its private IP (initially failed)
- Investigated and resolved the issue by:
  - Updating the Network ACL to allow ICMP traffic from the public subnet
  - Updating the private instance’s security group to allow ICMP traffic from the public security group
- Successfully pinged the private EC2 instance from the public one
- Verified internet access from the public EC2 instance using the `curl` command

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Connect to Public EC2 Instance**
   - Go to **EC2 Dashboard → Instances**
   - Select the public instance
   - Click **Connect → EC2 Instance Connect**
   - Leave default settings and click **Connect**

2. **Try to Ping the Private EC2 Instance**
   - Open a new tab, go to the EC2 console, and copy the **Private IPv4 address** of the private instance
   - Switch back to the EC2 Instance Connect terminal
   - Run:
     ```bash
     ping [PRIVATE-IP]
     ```
   - You'll likely see only one line — the ping fails due to blocked ICMP traffic

3. **Update Network ACL for Private Subnet**
   - Go to **VPC Dashboard → Subnets → Private Subnet**
   - Click the linked **Network ACL**
   - Edit **Inbound Rules**:
     - Rule #: 100  
     - Type: All ICMP - IPv4  
     - Source: `10.0.0.0/24` (public subnet)
   - Edit **Outbound Rules**:
     - Rule #: 100  
     - Type: All ICMP - IPv4  
     - Destination: `10.0.0.0/24`
   - Save changes

4. **Update Security Group for Private Instance**
   - Go to **EC2 Dashboard → Security Groups**
   - Select the private EC2 instance’s security group
   - Edit **Inbound Rules**:
     - Type: All ICMP - IPv4  
     - Source: the **security group** used by the public EC2 instance
   - Save rules

5. **Re-Test Ping**
   - In the EC2 Instance Connect terminal, run:
     ```bash
     ping [PRIVATE-IP]
     ```
   - You should now see multiple lines — ping is successful

6. **Test Internet Access from Public EC2**
   - Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the ping
   - Run:
     ```bash
     curl example.com
     ```
   - You should see the raw HTML output — confirming internet connectivity

### Summary

In this project, I tested and verified both internal and external connectivity. I learned how to troubleshoot blocked traffic using ICMP (`ping`), update Network ACLs and Security Groups, and verify internet access from a public EC2 instance using `curl`. This was a valuable hands-on exercise in understanding and debugging VPC connectivity in AWS.
