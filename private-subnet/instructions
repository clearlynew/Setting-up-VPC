## Project 3: Creating a Private Subnet

**Goal:** Create a fully isolated private subnet with no internet access or allowed traffic.  
**Time Taken:** 15 mins

---

### What I Did

- Created a private subnet in the existing VPC  
- Created a custom route table with no route to the internet  
- Left the default network ACL configuration (no rules = deny all)  
- Did not attach any internet gateway or NAT

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create Private Subnet**
   - Go to "Subnets" > "Create Subnet"
   - VPC: `My-VPC`
   - Subnet name: `private-subnet`
   - Availability Zone: e.g., `us-east-1b`
   - IPv4 CIDR block: `10.0.1.0/24`
   - Click "Create Subnet"

2. **Create Route Table**
   - Go to "Route Tables" > "Create route table"
   - Name: `private-route`
   - VPC: `My-VPC`
   - Click "Create"
   - Select the route table > "Subnet Associations" > "Edit subnet associations"
     - Select `private-subnet`
     - Save
   - Do **not** add any route to `0.0.0.0/0` (no internet access)

3. **Use Default Network ACL**
   - No changes made to the default NACL
   - Since no rules are added, it blocks all inbound and outbound traffic by default
   - Subnet is completely isolated

---

### Summary

This project demonstrated how to create a fully private and isolated subnet in AWS. By not adding internet routes and leaving the default NACL (which denies all traffic), the subnet is completely cut off from both inbound and outbound communication. This setup is useful for testing isolation or simulating locked-down environments.
