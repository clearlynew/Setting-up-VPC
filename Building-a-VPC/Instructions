## Project 1: Build a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

**Goal:** Create the foundation of your AWS network with a custom VPC, one public subnet, and internet access.  
**Time Taken:** ~15 minutes

---

### What I Did

- Created a custom VPC with the CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`
- Created one subnet in an Availability Zone (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`)
- Enabled auto-assign public IPv4 addresses for the subnet
- Created and attached an internet gateway to the VPC
- Associated the subnet with a route table that routes traffic to the internet gateway

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create VPC**
   - Go to VPC Dashboard > "Your VPCs" > "Create VPC"
   - Name: `My-VPC`
   - IPv4 CIDR block: `10.0.0.0/16`
   - Leave IPv6 and tenancy as default
   - Click "Create VPC"

2. **Create Subnet**
   - Go to "Subnets" > "Create Subnet"
   - VPC: `MyCustomVPC`
   - Subnet name: `Public-1`
   - AZ: choose one
   - IPv4 CIDR block: `10.0.1.0/24`
   - Click "Create Subnet"

3. **Enable Auto-Assign Public IP**
   - Select the subnet > "Actions" > "Modify auto-assign IP settings"
   - Enable "Auto-assign IPv4 address"
   - Save changes

4. **Create and Attach Internet Gateway**
   - Go to "Internet Gateways" > "Create internet gateway"
   - Name: `My-internet-gateway`
   - Create and attach to `My-VPC`

### Summary

This project helped me understand the basic building blocks of a VPC in AWS. I created a custom VPC, a public subnet, and enabled internet connectivity through an internet gateway.
