## Project 7: VPC Monitoring with Flow Logs

**Goal:** Enable monitoring of VPC network traffic using VPC Flow Logs and analyze data with CloudWatch Logs.  
**Time Taken:** ~45 minutes

---

### What I Did

- Created IAM policies specifically for VPC Flow Logs
- Assigned an IAM role with permissions to publish to CloudWatch Logs (only usable by VPC Flow Logs)
- Enabled VPC Flow Logs for my VPC and directed logs to a new CloudWatch log group
- Created a test EC2 instance in a public subnet
- Ran multiple ping tests:
  - Pinged another EC2 instance using its **private IP** —  worked
  - Pinged its **public IP** from inside AWS —  did not work (expected)
  - Pinged the public IP from my **laptop** —  initially failed
  - Updated EC2’s **security group** to allow **All ICMP - IPv4** from `0.0.0.0/0`
  -  Ping from my laptop to EC2’s public IP succeeded after that
- Opened CloudWatch → Log Groups → Viewed the flow log stream
- Used CloudWatch Logs Insights to query and analyze traffic patterns

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create IAM Role for Flow Logs**
   - Go to **IAM > Roles > Create role**
   - Use **VPC Flow Logs** as the trusted service
   - Attach a custom policy (or `AWSFlowLogs` managed policy)
   - Example permission:
     {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}


2. **Enable VPC Flow Logs**
   - Go to **VPC Dashboard > Your VPCs > Select VPC > Flow Logs tab**
   - Click **Create flow log**
   - Destination: **Send to CloudWatch Logs**
   - Select the IAM role created above
   - Create or select a log group (e.g. `/vpc-flow-logs-project7`)

3. **Launch EC2 Instances**
   - Ensure at least one EC2 is in a **public subnet** with a **public IP**
   - Use default Amazon Linux 2023, `t2.micro`
   - Attach a security group with minimal rules (HTTP/ICMP)

4. **Test Connectivity**
   - From EC2: `ping [private IP]` →  works
   - From EC2: `ping [public IP]` →  doesn't work inside VPC (expected)
   - From laptop: `ping [public IP]` → initially failed
   - Updated the EC2's **security group** to allow:
     - **Type**: All ICMP - IPv4
     - **Source**: `0.0.0.0/0`
   - Retested from laptop —  now works

5. **Analyze Logs in CloudWatch**
   - Go to **CloudWatch > Log Groups > Your log group**
   - View **log stream** tied to the ENI
   - Use **Log Insights** to run queries like:
     ```sql
     stats sum(bytes) as bytesTransferred by srcAddr, dstAddr
     | sort bytesTransferred desc
     | limit 10
     ```
   - Observed both **ACCEPT** and **REJECT** actions for traffic

### Summary

This project taught me how to enable and configure VPC Flow Logs to monitor network traffic. I created IAM policies and roles to allow secure log publishing to CloudWatch. I tested multiple ping scenarios and saw how flow logs reflect network behavior depending on security group rules. This gave me hands-on experience in AWS network observability and troubleshooting.
